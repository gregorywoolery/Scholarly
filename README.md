## Inspiration
The inspiration behind Scholarly came from the tedious process that hopeful applicants go through yearly to find a scholarship. More often than not, the applicant will have to manually filter out which scholarships they can apply for based on a certain criteria. 


## What it does
Scholarly make finding scholarships for college students easier. Additionally, it presents the student with a scholarship/s that relates to their field and year of study.


## List your Chatbotâ€™s features and use cases
1. It displays a clickable buttons to the user 
2. It solves the age-old problem of having to scan through many scholarship application websites/apps
3. Presents users with list of scholarships that match their criteria

3. Learning python
 
 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
